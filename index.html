      <h3 class="content-header-mine">Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        High quality tutoring is often only offered at a ridiculously high price, making it a luxury that working class families and communities cannot afford. We do not see effective learning as a luxury; we see it as a right. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The mission of TutorTogether is to make high-quality private tutoring available to all those that seek it, at whatever price they are willing and able to pay. All proceeds from tutoring fees are invested into providing this vital service to as many students as possible. Together, we can work to ensure that every child in this community receives the education that they need and deserve.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Organizational Model</h3>

      <p>
        Our organization is driven exclusively by impact, not profit. All revenue generated by our tutoring services is reinvested into our organization in order to enhance the services we offer and expand our outreach to more students. This model allows us to be an
        independent, self-sustaining organization, meaning we can prioritize the development of our students above all else. We focus on improving the academic understanding and organizational skills needed for our kids to be the best students they can be.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Service</h3>

      <p>
        Our tutors work to enhance student understanding of content as well as their ability to stay focused, motivated, and organized. By doing so, we do improve state test scores, but that is not the primary goal of our organization. We are not interested in evaluating our students by
        constantly testing them the way our nation’s public school system does. We simply work to develop their academic skills and understanding, and this work translates to improved grades and test scores.But far more importantly, it allows them to get the most out of their education.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Payment Policy</h3>

      <p>
        No one is required to pay anything for our service, because we believe that all people deserve a high-quality education regardless of your income. However, we do recommend that everyone who is able pay anything at all do so. Our recommended rate is anywhere from $5 to $20 an hour depending on each student’s financial situation.
